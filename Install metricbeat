# This is the Playbook for installing the Metricbeat on the Linux client, which altogether adds the yum repository
# and subsequently insatlls the Metricbeat agent and then copies the customised metricbeat.yml file from the ansible
# master to the remote client and sets the permission sets as well and starts the metricbeart at last.
